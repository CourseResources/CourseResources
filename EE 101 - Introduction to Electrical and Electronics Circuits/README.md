EE 101 - Introduction to Electrical and Electronics Circuits
========

Author:Manish Goregaokar

Basic EE course, about electrical circuits, transistors, MOSFETs including semiconductor physics and engineering, and various other topics like opamps

The notes contain various formulae which I found useful to remember for this course.

They were also useful as the (allowed) exam cheatsheet

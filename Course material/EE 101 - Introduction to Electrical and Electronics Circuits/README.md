EE 101 - Intro to Electrical Circuits and Electronics
========

**Author:Manish Goregaokar**

Basic EE course, about electrical circuits, transistors, MOSFETs including semiconductor physics and engineering, and various other topics like opamps

The notes contain various formulae which I found useful to remember for this course.

They were also useful as the (allowed) exam cheatsheet
